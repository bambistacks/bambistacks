### ☆ 𝘼𝙗𝙤𝙪𝙩 𝙈𝙚
I am a Software Engineering student working toward becoming a Product Developer, Product Designer, UI Developer, Application Developer, or Front-End Developer. I am passionate about creating intuitive user experiences and visually engaging interfaces, with a strong focus on minimalist aesthetic. I find it interesting how abstraction can transform complexity into simplicity, making technology both functional and seamless.  <br>
<br>
I’m particularly inspired by wearable technology and medical devices, with a strong interest in developing applications that process data, improve workflows, and deliver impactful user experiences. I also enjoy integrating APIs to create dynamic and connected solutions.<br>

My areas of interest include designing and developing websites, desktop and mobile applications, wearable tech, and other user-centered software that bridges design and functionality.
